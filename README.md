# calculator

The basic outline of calculator's logic took me ~2 hours + ~3 hours to polish it to the said requirements of the course. Initailly I moved quite fast and made a lot of progress, however, the details and polishing took me quite a while. 

1. I don't find pleasure in styling. Cleared css file eventually.
2. Evaluation of expression is done by putting values in a variable as a string, converting it to array, finding where the operator and forming operands from there, then passing them to the calculation function that determines which type of calculation is required according to the operator.
3. You can still input more than one dot after inputting an operator.
4. I bet I won't understand how my code works in two days (I'm not sure I understand it rigt now though). You could probably write this in half the lines.
